        <p class="q">What Is Breadth First Search algorithm</p>
        Breadth first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from root node and explores
        all the neighbouring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explore all the unexplored nodes. The
        algorithm follows the same process for each of the nearest node until it finds the goal.

        <p class=q>What Is Depth First Search algorithm</p>
        Depth first search (DFS) algorithm starts with the initial node of
        the graph G, and then goes to deeper and deeper until we find the goal node or the node which has no children.
        The algorithm, then backtracks from the dead end towards the most recent node that is yet to be completely
        unexplored.
